# MP3 Tag Reader

Yes, yes, there is no shortage of apps that read the metadata [tags](https://id3.org/Home) inside MP3 files, but it seemed like a fun exercise.

I have long used, and highly recommend, [MP3TAG](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to view and edit the metadata tags in my MP3 files, but got to wondering how it was doing the magic that it does.

I loaded an MP3 into the nifty online hex file viewer [HexEd.it](https://hexed.it/), and presto! there were the tags. I searched around on Stack Overflow and got inspiration and a leg up from [How to read Id3v2 tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16399604/how-to-read-id3v2-tag). I found a wealth of further details on the [ID3v2 Developer Information page](https://id3.org/Developer%20Information), and was off to the races.

But then...I noticed that my MP3 files also had old school [ID3v1 tags](https://id3.org/ID3v1), so I added support for those.

And then...while normalizing the volume level on my MP3 files using [MP3Gain](https://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/), I found that it added old school [APEv2 tags](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=APEv2_specification) to the files, so I added support for these as well. 

## Application Command Line Options
The command line options are:
```
Usage: Mp3TagReader [options]

Options:
  -?|-h|--help                   Show help information.
  -fs|--fileSpec <FileSpec>      The location of the MP3 file(s). Wildcards may be used. If a folder is provided, all
                                 MP3 files in the folder will be selected.
  -sf|--sortFrames               If provided, Id3v2 frames will be sorted by Id; otherwise they will appear in physical
                                 order. Helpful if you are diffing the JSON output.
  -of|--outputFolder[:<Folder>]  Optional destination folder to write output JSON file(s). If omitted, the MP3 source
                                 folder will be used.                                 
```
### Command Line Examples
This command does not specify an output folder, so the JSON output is written to the console (see below for an example of the output):
```
> Mp3TagReader -fs "c:\Music\U2\War\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.mp3"
```
This command does not specify an output folder, so the JSON output is written to the console with the ID3v2 frames in sorted order:
```
> Mp3TagReader -fs "c:\Music\U2\War\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.mp3" -sf
```
This command produces ***c:\Music\U2\War\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.json***:
```
> Mp3TagReader -fs "c:\Music\U2\War\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.mp3" -of
```
This command produces ***c:\tags\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.json***:
```
> Mp3TagReader -fs "c:\Music\U2\War\01 Sunday Bloody Sunday.mp3" -of:c:\tags
```
This command outputs JSON for each MP3 in the folder to the console:
```
> Mp3TagReader -fs "c:\Music\U2\War\*.mp3"
```
## Example JSON Output
Since the output is so verbose, here is just one example. It corresponds to the first command line example above:
